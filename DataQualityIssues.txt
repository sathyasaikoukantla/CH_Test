I have added the tests for most of the not null and unique constrains in dbt, I have also handled a few data quality issues in while transforming the data in the transform layer, These were a few DQ issues i found while i was exploring the data,

1. Patient ID was in upper case in a few table's (Conditions, Encounters)
2. Date of Birth was '9999-99-99' for 150 Patients 
3. Symptoms Table had a Symptoms columns which wasn't ready to use, Transformed it to make sure it will be easy to consume
4. Gender was populated as 'NaN' in Patients and Symptoms Tables
5. no_of_symptoms is not accurate in Symptoms Table
6. convert encounter_id to lower case in Medications
